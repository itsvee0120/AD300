# Outside of class projects
* Developed a diverse array of personal projects to extend Component Software class assignments,
enhancing comprehension of key concepts through the integration of features such as graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
* Packaged Java applications for distribution using GraalVM's native-image to improve performance and deployment efficiency.

## Google Drive
All of my applications can be [found here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xoAnxlHlmkkY-YMVm9t5hXUrryiei4xd?usp=drive_link). I will try to do one outside of class projects for every assignment (Currently 1 per week) and updated this repo as well as my Google Drive.

**To download and run the applications please ensure you have [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
