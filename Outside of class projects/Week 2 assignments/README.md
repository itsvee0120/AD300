# Animal Kingdom GUI Application

## Overview
The **Animal Kingdom GUI Application** is a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to explore various animals in an engaging and interactive manner. Users can select different animals from a dropdown menu and view detailed information about each one, including their characteristics and behaviors.

## Features
- **Animal Selection**: Users can choose from a list of animals, including Dog, Cat, Fish, Bird, Lion, Rabbit, Elephant, and Cheetah.

- **Animated Interface**: The welcome label moves across the screen, enhancing the user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The GUI adjusts to show a scrollbar when necessary for easy navigation of animal information.
