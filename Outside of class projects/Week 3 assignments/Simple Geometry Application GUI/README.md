# Simple GUI Application

## Objective
This Java application implements a graphical user interface (GUI) to demonstrate the use of Swing components and layout management in Java. It allows users to interact with the application through buttons, showcasing the principles of event handling and GUI design.

## Overview
The application utilizes `JFrame` as the main window and includes a button panel to host various buttons. It demonstrates how to effectively manage layout and user interactions, ensuring that components are properly displayed and functional.

## Features
- **Main Frame**: A primary window (`JFrame`) that serves as the applicationâ€™s interface.
- **Button Panel**: A `JPanel` that contains buttons for user interactions.
- **Button Actions**: Each button performs specific actions when clicked, demonstrating event handling.
- **Layout Management**: Utilizes `FlowLayout` for button arrangement, allowing for a dynamic and responsive design.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
- An IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) or text editor to run the code.

## Implementation
### Main Class
The main class sets up the `JFrame` and initializes the components, including the button panel. The buttons are added to the panel, and action listeners are assigned to handle user interactions.
