# Word Counter & Word Frequency Counter - README

## Overview

The **Word Counter & Word Frequency Counter** application allows users to upload `.doc`, `.docx`, or `.txt` files and view the total word count along with the frequency of each word in the document. The application uses Apache POI for reading `.doc` and `.docx` files, and provides a simple GUI for ease of use.

2. **Add Apache POI Library**:
    - Download the latest Apache POI libraries from [Apache POI](https://poi.apache.org/download.html).
    - Include `poi`, `poi-ooxml`, and any other required JAR files in your projectâ€™s build path.

3. **Run the Program**:
    - Compile and run the `MyFrame` class to launch the application.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Launch the Application**: Run the `MyFrame` class to open the application window.
2. **Select a File**: Click the "Select File" button, choose a `.doc`, `.docx`, or `.txt` file from your computer, and confirm.
3. **View Results**:
    - The **total word count** appears in the bottom text area.
    - The **word frequency list** is displayed in the main results area with indented formatting.
4. **Reset the Display**: Click the "Reset" button to clear all text areas and prepare for a new file selection.

## Code Structure

- **Main Class**: `MyFrame`
    - **GUI Components**:
        - `JFrame`, `JLabel`, `JButton`, `JTextArea`, `JScrollPane` for the main UI layout.
        - `selectButton` and `resetButton` for file selection and resetting the text areas.
    - **File Reading Methods**:
        - `readDocFile(File file)`: Reads `.doc` files.
        - `readDocxFile(File file)`: Reads `.docx` files.
        - `readTxtFile(File file)`: Reads `.txt` files and calculates word frequencies.
    - **Helper Methods**:
        - `appendIndentedResult(String text)`: Appends formatted text to `resultArea`.
        - `processParagraphs(String[] paragraphs)`: Processes paragraphs to calculate word counts and frequencies.

## Notes

- Ensure that the `src/main/resources` directory contains an image file named `frog.png` (used as an icon in the button panel).
- Modify `fileChooser.setCurrentDirectory` to set a default directory if needed.
- The application currently supports English words and strips punctuation; this can be adapted to support other languages.

## Dependencies

- Java JDK 8 or above
- Apache POI libraries (for `.doc` and `.docx` file reading)
